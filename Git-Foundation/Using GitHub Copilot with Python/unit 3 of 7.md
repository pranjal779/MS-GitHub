Completed

5 minutes
In this exercise, we create a new repository using the GitHub template for the JavaScript personal portfolio frontend web application.

Sign up for GitHub Copilot
Before you install and use the extension, you need to register by setting up a free trial or subscription for your account.

 Note

Educators, Students and select open-source maintainers can sign up for Copilot for free, learn how at: https://aka.ms/Copilot4Students

Environment setup
First you need to launch the Codespaces environment, which comes preconfigured with the GitHub Copilot extension.

Open the Codespace with the preconfigured environment in your browser.
On the Create codespace page, review the codespace configuration settings, then select Create new codespace.
Wait for the codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.
The remaining exercises in this project take place in the context of this development container.
 Important

All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with 2 core instances. For more information, see GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours.

Python Web API
When complete, Codespaces loads with a terminal section at the bottom. Codespaces installs all the required extensions in your container. Once the package installs are completed, Codespaces executes the uvicorn command to start your web application running within your Codespace.

When the web application successfully starts, a message in the terminal shows that the server is running on port 8000 within your Codespace.

Testing the API
In the Simple Browser tab of your Codespace, on the Containerized Python API page, select the Try it out button. A FastAPI page opens in the Simple Browser tab that allows you to interact with the API by sending a request using the self-documented page.

To test the API, select the POST button and then the Try it Out button. Scroll down the tab and select Execute. If you scroll down the tab further, you can see the response to your sample request.
