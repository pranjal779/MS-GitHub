Now that you've created your Project, added issues and pull requests, and organized it, let's talk about how to:  
  
- Provide visibility and access to your Project
- And how to close and delete your Project

## Project visibility and access

In this portion of the unit, we'll go over the following:

- Who has visibility to your Project
- Who has access and who can manage access to your Project
- Who can manage access to your Project
- Steps to add individuals, teams, and change their roles for both organization-level and personal/user-level Projects
- Adding a Project to a team
- Adding a Project to a repository

## Who has visibility to your Project

You have the ability to control whether or not your Project is public or private. When your Project is public, everyone on the internet can view it. When your Project is private, only users granted at least read access can see your Project.

To change your Project's visibility:

1) First navigate to your Project.

2) In the top-right, click the three dots at the top menu.

3) Then select the Settings to access to your Project.

4) Next to the Visibility in the "Danger zone," select Private or Public.

## Who has access and who can manage access to your Project
Access to your Project depends on if your Project is an organization-level Project or a personal/user-level Project, but managing access is similar between the two levels.

## Who can manage access to your Project
Admins of organization-level Projects can manage access for the entire organization, for teams, for individual organization members, and for outside collaborators. Admins of user-level Projects can invite individual collaborators and manage their access.

### Organization level Project
- **No access:** Only organization owners and users granted individual access can see the Project. Organization owners are also admins for the Project.
- **Read:** Everyone in the organization can see the Project. Organization owners are also admins for the Project.
- **Write:** Everyone in the organization can see and edit the Project. Organization owners are also admins for the Project.
- **Admin:** Everyone in the organization is an admin for the Project.
### Personal/User level Project
- **Read:** The individual can view the Project.
- **Write:** The individual can view and edit the Project.
- **Admin:** The individual can view, edit, and add new collaborators to the Project.

## Steps to add individuals, teams, and change their roles for both organization-level and personal/user-level Projects
1) Navigate to your Project.

2) In the top right, click the three dots to open the menu.

3) In the menu, click Settings to access the Project's settings.

4) Then, in the left-hand navigation bar, click on the option Manage access.

5) Once on the page you can either:
    - Invite individuals and teams by searching in the Invite collaborators search bar
    - Change their role in your Project
    - Or remove them from your Project

## Adding a Project to a team
You can add Projects to your team to give the whole team collaborator access to their Projects. When you add a Project to a team, that Project is listed on the team's Projects page, making it easier for members to identify which Projects a particular team uses.

Teams are granted read permissions on any Project they're added to. To change permissions, see the preceding section, "[Who has access and who can manage access to your Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-work-github-projects/5-how-to-organize-automate-project#who-has-access-and-who-can-manage-access-to-your-project)".

Steps to adding Projects to teams:

1) In the top right corner of GitHub.com, click your profile photo, then click **Your organizations**.
2) Click the name of your organization.
3) Under your organization name, click **Teams**.
4) On the Teams tab, click the name of the team you want to grant access to.
5) Next, click **Projects**.
6) Then, click **Add project**.
7) Start typing the name of the Project you want to add and then select the Project in the list of matches.

## Adding a Project to a repository
You can list relevant Projects in a repository so your team can access information they need to stay up-to-date. But it's worth noting you can only list Projects that are owned by the same user or organization that owns the repository. In order for repository members to see a Project listed in a repository, they must have visibility to the Project.

To change permissions see the above section, "[Who has access and who can manage access to your Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-work-github-projects/5-how-to-organize-automate-project#who-has-access-and-who-can-manage-access-to-your-project)".

Here are the steps to add a Project to a repository:

1) On GitHub, navigate to the main page of your repository.

2) Click Projects.

3) Next, click Add project.
![5-add-project](https://github.com/pranjal779/MS-GitHub/assets/50409572/6fea4291-9d99-445b-baa7-d9a716db94a4)

4) In the search bar that appears, search for Projects that are owned by the same user or organization that owns the repository.

5) Then, click on a Project to list the Project in your repository.

## Closing and deleting Projects
Once you've completed a Project or you no longer need to use a Project, you can either close or delete the project.

Closing a Project enables you to remove it from the list of Projects but retain the content and ability to re-open the Project later. We recommend this option to preserve your data.

Deleting a Project, however, permanently removes your Project from the platform along with any saved views, custom fields and associated values, insights data, and drafted issues.

Regardless of which option you choose, both closing and deleting Project settings are in the same location.

Here are steps on how to navigate to them:

1) Navigate to your Project.

2) In the top-right, click the three dots to open the menu.

3) In the menu, click Settings to access the Project settings.

4) At the bottom of the page, within the "Danger zone" section you can either select Close project or Delete project.

    - If you select Delete project, you'll be prompted to read the warnings, then type the name of your Project into the text box.

Next up, we'll be reviewing insights and automation in Projects.
