### 1. Which of the following choices best describes the relationship between open source and InnerSource programs? 

Anyone can offer a contribution to an open source program, whereas InnerSource programs only accept contributions from members of the team that owns the repository.

InnerSource programs are forked from open source programs by organizations that only use and maintain them privately moving forward.

InnerSource programs are fundamentally the same as open source programs, except that their access is limited to people within their organization.
InnerSource offers all of the benefits of traditional open source patterns, but to a limited audience in order to protect intellectual property.

### 2. Suppose your team has been receiving some low-quality bug reports without enough information to properly diagnose. Which of the following choices is the best way to address the issue? 

Use GitHub Script to add a workflow action that automatically rejects any issues with a description fewer than 200 characters long.

Add an ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file that includes fields for reproduction steps, system properties, and instructions for generating and including important logs.
This file will ensure that anyone filing a bug knows what's expected of them at the moment they're writing the report.


Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file that clearly explains what's expected in bug reports, such as reproduction steps, system properties, and instructions for generating and including important logs.

### 3. Suppose your team has been tracking data of all kinds since your InnerSource program went live three months ago. Which of the following metrics indicates your program is a great success? 

A dramatic rise in pull requests that address bugs in your software.
This metric indicates that more people are motivated to improve the quality of your software and are making the investment themselves.


A growing rate of bug reports that are quickly closed because they cannot be reproduced.

A steady decline in new issues.
