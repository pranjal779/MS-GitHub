This exercise allows you to practice the content covered in this module: use Markdown to communicate effectively on GitHub.  

Get started  
When you select the Start the exercise on GitHub button below, you'll be directed to a public GitHub template repository that will prompt you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the below tasks:  

- Select the Start course button or the Use this template feature within the template repository. This will prompt you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.
