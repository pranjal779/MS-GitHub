# Exercise - Communicate using Markdown
Completed  
100 XP 
48 minutes  
This exercise allows you to practice the content covered in this module: use Markdown to communicate effectively on GitHub.  

Get started  
When you select the Start the exercise on GitHub button below, you'll be directed to a public GitHub template repository that will prompt you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the below tasks:  

- Select the Start course button or the Use this template feature within the template repository. This will prompt you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

- Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you finish the exercise in GitHub, return here to:  

[X]Complete a quick knowledge check  
[X]Review a summary of what you've learned  
[X]Earn a badge for completing this module  
 
 !Note

You don't need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise. Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results.

### Exercise
### Communicate using Markdown
Organize ideas and collaborate using Markdown, a lightweight language for text formatting.

Welcome
GitHub is about more than code. It‚Äôs a platform for software collaboration, and Markdown is one of the most important ways developers can make their communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests. This course will walk you through creating and using headings more effectively, organizing thoughts in bulleted lists, and showing how much work you‚Äôve completed with checklists. You can even use Markdown to add some depth to your work with the help of emoji, images, and links.

Who is this for: New developers, new GitHub users, and students.
What you'll learn: Use Markdown to add lists, images, and links in a comment or text file.
What you'll build: We'll update a plain text file and add Markdown formatting, and you can use this file to start your own GitHub Pages site.
Prerequisites: In this course you will work with pull requests as well as edit files. If these things aren't familiar to you, we recommend you take the Introduction to GitHub course, first!
How long: This course takes less than one hour to complete.
In this course, you will:

Add headers
Add an image
Add a code example
Make a task list
Merge your pull request
How to start this course
start-course

Right-click Start course and open the link in a new tab.
In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use Actions minutes.
Scroll down and click the Create repository button at the bottom of the form.
After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

Step 1: Add headers
Welcome to "Communicate using Markdown"! üëã

What is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight syntax for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add a heading, lists, bold, italics, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:

Comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
Sharing snippets of text in Gists
What is a header? A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

Example
# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest

## This is an `<h2>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest
How it looks
This is an <h1> header, which is the largest  
This is an <h2> header  
This is an <h6> header, which is the smallest 


‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Edit your file with headers  
Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.  
Open the pull requests tab.  
Click New pull request, for the branches to compare, select base: main and compare: start-markdown.  
Click Create pull request.  
In this pull request, go to the Files changed tab. We made an empty file index.md for you.  
Select Edit file from the three dotted ... menu in the upper right corner of the file view on index.md.  
On the Edit file tab, add a #, followed by a space, before any content you like to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six # characters followed by a space.  
Above your new content, click Preview.  
At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.  
Click Commit changes.  
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.

Step 2: Add an image
Great job adding headers to the file ‚ú®

Let's add an image. Include descriptive text in the square brackets. This text is read aloud for people using screen readers. It's also shown at times when your image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection. You can see the syntax for images below:

Example
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
How it looks
Image of Yaktocat

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Adding an image
As you did before, edit the index.md file in this pull request.
In the file, add the correct Markdown for your image of choice. Don't forget to include alt-text!
Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.
Commit your changes.
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.

Step 3: Add a code example
Great job adding an image to the file üéâ

In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as JavaScript or command-line text.

Example 1
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
How it looks
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
Example 2
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
How it looks
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Adding a code example
As you did before, edit the file in this pull request.
In the file, add the correct Markdown for a code example of your choice.
Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.
Commit your changes.
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.


Step 4: Make a task list
Great job adding a code example to the file ü•≥

What is a task list? A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.

Example
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
How it looks
 List syntax is required
 This item is complete
 This item is not complete
‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Add a task list
GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!

Return to your pull request.

Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world
Remember, a task list starts with the syntax - [ ] and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!

Use the Preview tab to check your Markdown formatting.

Commit the changes to the file.

Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.

Step 5: Merge your pull request
Great job adding a task list to the file ‚ù§Ô∏è

You can now merge your pull request!

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Merge your pull request
Click Merge pull request.
Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.

Finish
Congratulations friend, you've completed this course!
