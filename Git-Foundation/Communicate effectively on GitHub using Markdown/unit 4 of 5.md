1. Which of the following Markdown snippets would produce the text Hello, world! in bold italics? 

*Hello, *world*!*

**Hello, *world*!**
Incorrect. This snippet would produce Hello, world!.


***Hello, world!***
Correct. Remember that you can also use underscores (_) instead of asterisks if you prefer.


### Hello, world!
2. How do you print certain characters, like asterisks (*) and underscores (_), literally on your output? 

Use three in a row, like *** or ___.

Escape them with a backslash, like \* or \_.
Correct. You can also escape other reserved characters, including { and #, using backslashes.


Unfortunately, this isn't supported at this time.
3. Suppose there's an HTML snippet that you want to include on your GitHub Pages web site, but Markdown doesn't offer a way to render it. What should you do? 

Just add the HTML inline.
Correct. Markdown isn't a complete replacement for HTML. You might need to add HTML to get the final results you're looking for.


Cut the content. If it's not supported in Markdown, then it's probably not worth including.

Open an issue that requests Markdown support for your specialized scenario.
