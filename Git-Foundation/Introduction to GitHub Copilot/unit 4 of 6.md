## Getting started
When you select the Start the exercise on GitHub button, you're navigated to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

Select the Start course button or the Use this template feature within the template repository. This action prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, because private repositories use Actions minutes. After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

Follow the instructions in the repository's README to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return back to this module for:

- A quick knowledge check  
- A summary of what you've learned  
- To earn a badge for completing this module  
 
 Note

You don't need to modify any of the workflow files to complete this exercise. Altering the contents in this workflow can break the exercise's ability to validate your actions, provide feedback, or grade the results.

## Step 1: Leverage Codespaces with VS Code for Copilot
Welcome to "Develop With AI Powered Code Suggestions Using GitHub Copilot and VS Code"! üëã

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI.

**Copilot works with many code editors including VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDE, and Neovim.**

Additionally, GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language.

Using Copilot inside a Codespace shows just how easy it is to get up and running with GitHub's suite of Collaborative Coding tools.

Note This skills exercise will focus on leveraging GitHub Codespace. It is recommended that you complete the GitHub skill, Codespaces, before moving forward with this exercise.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Enable Copilot inside a Codespace
**We recommend opening another browser tab to work through the following activities so you can keep these instructions open for reference.**

Before you open up a codespace on a repository, you can create a development container and define specific extensions or configurations that will be used or installed in your codespace. Let's create this development container and add copilot to the list of extensions.

1) Navigating back to your Code tab of your repository, click the Add file drop-down button, and then click Create new file.

2) Type or paste the following in the empty text field prompt to name your file.

```
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
```

3) In the body of the new .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file, add the following content:

```
{
    // Name this configuration
    "name": "Codespace for Skills!",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "GitHub.copilot"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

4) Select the option to Commit directly to the main branch, and then click the Commit new file button.

5) Navigate back to the home page of your repository by clicking the Code tab located at the top left of the screen.

6) Click the Code button located in the middle of the page.

7) Click the Codespaces tab on the box that pops up.

8) Click the Create codespace on main button.

**Wait about 2 minutes for the codespace to spin itself up.**

9) Verify your codespace is running. The browser should contain a VS Code web-based editor and a terminal should be present such as the below:![224102962-d0222578-3f10-4566-856d-8d59f28fcf2e](https://github.com/pranjal779/MS-GitHub/assets/50409572/832a6797-a6ba-4cbb-972b-cd987aca1688)
 Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 9 09 07 AM

10) The copilot extension should show up in the VS Code extension list. Click the extensions sidebar tab. You should see the following:![224102514-7d6d2f51-f435-401d-a529-7bae3ae3e511](https://github.com/pranjal779/MS-GitHub/assets/50409572/3f9328cd-6eec-412f-891c-95d90e2bba08)

## Step 2: Seeing AI code suggestions in a Javascript file!
Nice work! üéâ You created a Codespace using a devcontainer file that installed Copilot!

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. The following samples are in JavaScript, but other languages will work similarly.

Let's try this out utilizing Javascript for Copilot.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Add a Javascript file and start writing code
1) From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file.
Note: If you closed the Codespace from above, please open it back up or create a new Codespace.

2) Name the file skills.js

3) Verify your new file looks like:![224105906-d1beb531-b747-4c7a-85ba-a12526488422](https://github.com/pranjal779/MS-GitHub/assets/50409572/d2533b40-dd98-4a04-a8ba-c463e18fbb2c)
 Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 9 21 34 AM

4) In the skills.js file, type the following function header.
```
function calculateNumbers(var1, var2)
```
GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text. Below is an example of what you'll most likely see, but the exact suggestion may vary. ![234941079-b4bf3e9d-fc70-4b20-b74c-0ee753ba344e](https://github.com/pranjal779/MS-GitHub/assets/50409572/c986a7cd-b53b-418b-9a37-389f80c07dbb)
 Screen Shot 2023-04-27 at 10 23 06 AM

5) Press Tab to accept the suggestion.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Push code to your repository from the codespace
1) Use the VS Code terminal to add the skills.js file to the repository:

```
git add skills.js
```
2) Next from the VS Code terminal stage and commit the changes to the repository:
```
git commit -m "Copilot first commit"
```
3) Finally from the VS Code terminal push to code to the repository:
```
git push
```
**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**
