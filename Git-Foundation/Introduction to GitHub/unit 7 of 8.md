1. What is the best way to report a bug to a GitHub project? 

Send an email to a project owner.

I don't bother reporting software bugs because there's no transparency and they never get fixed anyway.

=> Search for the bug in the project's existing issues and create a new one if it hasn't been reported yet.
A project's issues are visible to anyone who has access to the project, so you might find a resolution is already planned or available. Otherwise, you can create and track the issue yourself.

2. Suppose you created a bug fix on a new branch and want it to become part of the next production build generated from the main branch. What should you do next? 

Copy your branch changes and commit them directly to the main branch.

=> Create a pull request to merge your new branch into the main branch.
Pull requests are the correct way to communicate that commits are ready for review and ultimate inclusion on the main branch.


On second thought, maybe I won't share this fix. I'll just put it in my own private version of the source code.
3. Suppose you'd like to work with a project on GitHub, but you don't have write access to the project. What can you do to contribute? 

=> Fork the project's repository to your GitHub account, clone the forked repository to your local machine, push changes to your repository, and submit a pull request to the target (upstream) repository.
GitHub provides forking functionality designed to allow you to work with projects where you aren't an owner or don't have write access. Forking makes a remote copy of the project in your repository that you can then clone locally. To submit updates to the target repository (upstream repository), you can submit a pull request.


Clone the project to your local machine and push updates directly to the project repository.

Use git commands to make a copy of the project so that you can work locally. Submit an issue to get your changes into the target repository.
