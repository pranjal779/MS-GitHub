Exercise - A guided tour of GitHub
Completed
100 XP
58 minutes
This exercise checks your knowledge of GitHub key features, including committing a branch, committing a file, opening a pull request, and merging a pull request.

Getting started
When you select the Start the exercise on GitHub button below, you'll be navigated to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

Select the Start course button or the Use this template feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, because private repositories will use Actions minutes.

After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

Follow the instructions in the repository's README file to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:

Introduction to GitHub
Get started using GitHub in less than an hour.

Step 2: Commit a file
You created a branch! üéâ

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the main branch. Now that you have a branch, it‚Äôs time to create a file and make your first commit!

What is a commit?: A [commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)".

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Your first commit
The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

1. On the < > Code tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch my-first-branch.

2. Select the Add file drop-down and click Create new file.

3. In the Name your file... field, enter PROFILE.md.

Note: .md is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)" Skills course.

In the Enter file contents here area, copy the following content to your file:

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Click Commit changes... in the upper right corner above the contents box. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter Add PROFILE.md in the first text-entry field titled "Commit message".

In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click Commit changes.

Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
