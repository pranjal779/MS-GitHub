58 minutes
This exercise checks your knowledge of GitHub key features, including committing a branch, committing a file, opening a pull request, and merging a pull request.

# [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/pranjal779/skills-introduction-to-github?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction-to-github)
Get started using GitHub in less than an hour.

Getting started
When you select the Start the exercise on GitHub button below, you'll be navigated to a public GitHub template repository that prompts you to complete a series of small challenges. Before you can begin the exercise, complete the following tasks:

Select the Start course button or the Use this template feature within the template repository. This prompts you to create a new repository. We recommend creating a public repository, because private repositories will use Actions minutes.

After you make your own repository from the template, wait about 20 seconds and refresh.

Follow the instructions in the repository's README file to understand how the exercise works, its learning objectives, and how to successfully complete the exercise.

When you've finished the exercise in GitHub, return here for:

which is about creating a branch
just click the code tab in the repo > click on main> write bracnh name > select the option with the branch name you just wrote > you branch is created

Introduction to GitHub
Get started using GitHub in less than an hour.

Step 2: Commit a file
You created a branch! üéâ

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the main branch. Now that you have a branch, it‚Äôs time to create a file and make your first commit!

What is a commit?: A [commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)".

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Your first commit
The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

1. On the < > Code tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch my-first-branch.

2. Select the Add file drop-down and click Create new file.

create new file option

3. In the Name your file... field, enter PROFILE.md.

Note: .md is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)" Skills course.

In the Enter file contents here area, copy the following content to your file:

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Click Commit changes... in the upper right corner above the contents box. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter Add PROFILE.md in the first text-entry field titled "Commit message".

In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click Commit changes.

Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.


[Step 3: Open a pull request](https://github.com/pranjal779/skills-introduction-to-github?tab=readme-ov-file#step-3-open-a-pull-request)
Nice work making that commit! ‚ú®

Now that you have made a change to the project and created a commit, it‚Äôs time to share your proposed change through a pull request!

What is a pull request?: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main project branch. For more information about pull requests, see "[About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)".

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create a pull request
You may have noticed after your commit that a message displayed indicating your recent push to your branch and providing a button that says Compare & pull request.

To create a pull request automatically, click Compare & pull request, and then skip to step 6 below. If you don't click the button, the instructions below walk you through manually setting up the pull request.

Click on the Pull requests tab in the header menu of your repository.

Click New pull request.

In the base: dropdown, make sure main is selected.

Select the compare: dropdown, and click my-first-branch.

Click Create pull request.

Enter a title for your pull request. By default, the title will automatically be the name of your branch. For this exercise, let's edit the field to say Add my first file.

The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Here, you can add a description of what you‚Äôve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a new branch, created a file, and made a commit.

Click Create pull request. You will automatically be navigated to your new pull request.

Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.

Note: You may see evidence of GitHub Actions running on the tab with the pull request opened! The image below shows a line you might see on your pull request after the Action finishes running.

[Step 4: Merge your pull request](https://github.com/pranjal779/skills-introduction-to-github?tab=readme-ov-file#step-4-merge-your-pull-request)
Nicely done! üòé

You successfully created a pull request. You can now merge your pull request.

What is a merge?: A merge adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch. For more information about merges, see "Merging a pull request."

As noted in the previous step, you may have seen evidence of GitHub Actions running which automatically progresses your instructions to the next step. You'll have to wait for it to finish before you can merge your pull request. It will be ready when the merge pull request button is green.

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Merge the pull request
Click Merge pull request.

Click Confirm merge.

Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore. To delete this branch, click Delete branch.

Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update to the next step.
